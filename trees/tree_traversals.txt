Preorder:
In a preorder traversal, we visit the root node first, 
then recursively do a preorder traversal of 
the left subtree, followed by a recursive 
preorder traversal of the right subtree

e.g. Reading a book

Inorder:
In an inorder traversal, we recursivey do an 
inorder traversal on the left subtree, visit the
root node, and finally do a recursive inorder 
traversal of the right subtree

e.g. 

Postorder:
In a postorder traversal, we recursively do a 
postorder traversal of the left subtree and the 
right subtree followed by a visit to the root
node.
